Uppler limits CDF
=================

If checked, use an cummulative distribution function based on a
Gaussion error distribution.

If unchecked, use a truncated chi-squared model for upper limits.
[See https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...724..341H] This
approach is much faster for single star matches, but may not make a
huge difference for GA and full multi-star searches It and usually
gives very similar relative ranking of models or model combinations.
