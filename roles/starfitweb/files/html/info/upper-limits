Uppler limits CDF
=================

If checked, use an cummulative distribution function based on a
Gaussion error distribution.

If unchecked, use a truncated chi-squared model for upper limits.

This approach is much faster - e.g., for GA or full multi-star
searches, and usually gives very similar relative ranking of models or
model combinations.
