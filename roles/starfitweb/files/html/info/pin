Pinning
=======

For genetic algorithm, databases can be put in groups (field `Group`)
, e.g., different r-process sources.  From each group, contributions
can be enforced once or multiple times (field `Pin`).

If not grouping is provided, each database is treated as its own
group.

Pinning can accelerate finding solutions that include contributions
form a group it that group has a lot fewer members than others.

Grouping can provide a better representation of the desired
astrophysics, e.g., massive star models or r-process contributions
from sifferent sources can be paired.
