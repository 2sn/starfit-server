Model lower limits
==================

In some case it is known that the models in the database do
underproduce a given species.  This may be due to production processes
not included in the modelling, other sources, or other nuclear physics
uncertainties.

In this case model data is considered a lower limit.

This is treated the same was as an upper limit for the observed data,
using the error bar form the observational data.

In the plots, these are shown as hollow symbols for the model data.

Data entry is elements name, symbol, or charge number, separated by
commas.  Ranges can be specified using a dash (minus sign).  Open
ranges extend from H or to U.
