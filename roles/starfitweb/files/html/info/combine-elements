Combine Elements
================

This is intended for elements for which the currently observed element
abundaces do not reflect the production, but the total abundace of the
elements is conserved to good approximation.

For example, the CN cycle first converts C to N, at higher temperature
or after nonger tme, also O is participating in the cycle.  Assuming
there is no break-out, the total number of nuclei is conserved in
these reactions.  Hence, even if not knowing the amount of processing,
we can still match the total.

Here we provide the options for C+N and C+N+O.

In the plots, the averate Z is used to locate the data point on the
x-axis.

The error bars are combined appropriately, with weight of the abundaces.

Currently, only data points can eb combined, not upper limits.

Please let us know if you ever get into a situation where you'd need
combinations for other limits for an astrophysically motivated use
case.
