Grouping
========

For multi-star evaluation, databases can be put in groups (field
`Group`) , e.g., different r-process sources.  Within each group, one
or several stars can be chosen (field `Number of Stars`).

If not grouping is provided, all stars are drawn from the full
distribution.

Grouping can cut down computational cost significantly, and also
provide a better representation of the desired astrophysics, e.g., one
massive star from models from different groups to be paired with an
r-process contributions from different sources.
