Limit Solver
============

If checked, each contribution will be limited to 100% mass
fraction. (recommended)

If unchecked, the sum of mass fractions may exceed 100%.

Background
----------

For some yield data bases no "mass" is provided.  Hence, by default
one solar mass is assumed.  For most cases, such as novae and
r-process, this should be a fairly conservative upper limit.

If only some elements are measured, matching these best may, however,
result in a formal contribution of a star of more than 100%, e.g.,
if calcium is matched but the star ejects a bunch of hydrogen and
helium.  You'd have to argue that you only mix with some inner part of
the star, which could be desirable, e.g., for grains and star dust.
