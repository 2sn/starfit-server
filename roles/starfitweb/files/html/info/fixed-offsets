Fixed Offsets
=============

If checked, use fixed ratios of ejecta, weighted by the mass of ejcta.

If unchecked, allow free floating ejecta ratios.

Backgtound
----------

In a binary system, e.g., you may want to assume bith stars contribute
equally.  In most cases, however, contributions may vary, e.g., if the
contribution of r-process from a binary neutron star merger may depend
a lot on GCE mixing with large dilution; for a collapsar, it may be
rather fixed, if known.

Note
----

Some data sets do not provide ejecta masses.  In this case, a standard
ejecta mass of 1 solar mass is assumed.
