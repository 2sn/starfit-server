Exclude Elements
================

Elements for which data exists but should not be used for matching.

This way, the povided dat file does not need to be adjusted to explore
the dependence of specific elements.

These elements are still plotted, but observed data points are shown
as hollow circiles.

Data entry is elements name, symbol, or charge number, separated by
commas.  Ranges can be specified using a dash (minus sign).  Open
ranges extend from H or to U.
