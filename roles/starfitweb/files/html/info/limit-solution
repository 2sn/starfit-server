Limit Solution
==============

If checked, the total solution will be limited to 100% mass
fraction, rescaled if needed. (recommended)

If unchecked, the sum of mass fractions may exceed 100%.

Background
----------

Whereas each of the solutions may be less than 100%, their sum might
not.  After an optimal solution is found, each contribution will be
scaled by the same factor.
